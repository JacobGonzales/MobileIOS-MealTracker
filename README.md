# [MobileIOS-MealTracker](https://github.com/JacobGonzales/MobileIOS-MealTracker)
I created this app August 2020 for my CS 3260 IOS mobile development class. The app is a basic meal tracker mobile application that lets you add, delete and edit entries. SQLite database is implemented to produce data persistance. Added a settings implementation to support dark mode, version and build information. Supports standard device rotation and implements standard use of IOS views. This app is coded using Swift 5, XCode 11.3, and IOS 13.2.
